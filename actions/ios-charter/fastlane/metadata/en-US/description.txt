Charter is a client to help you read the Swift mailing lists.

Charter lets you read the Swift programming language's mailing lists in an intuitive and enjoyable way.

— Read the Swift Evolution (swift-evolution), Swift Users (swift-users), and Swift Dev (swift-dev) mailing lists
— Message replies are threaded together to make discussion easy to follow
— Download the list contents to read online and offline
— View emails by message thread to follow the conversation
— Excessively long quotes in emails are truncated to remove noise

The mailing lists are where Swift developers come together to discuss the present and future of the language, and are a great way to stay up to date with best practices and the community's ideas around Swift.

Trying to follow a mailing list on the web or in an email client is a difficult, laborious task. It's almost impossible to follow the flow of conversation, and important points are lost in a sea of peculiar formatting. Charter strips out the noise and presents discussion in an intuitive format.
